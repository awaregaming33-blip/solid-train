# ScheduStudent Prototype

## Purpose
ScheduStudent is a minimal, student-facing assignment tracker that helps college students focus on what to do next. This version is directly runnable in a web browser on Windows with no emulator.

## Mock data
The browser prototype uses local mock assignment data in `web/app.js` with 10 assignments across four courses, including completed items and missing-date edge cases.

## UI philosophy
The interface is intentionally calm and distraction-free: one screen, light neutrals, subtle typography, a prioritized list, and a single completion slider.

## Fastest way to run on Windows (no emulation)
1. Open this folder in File Explorer.
2. Double-click `run-web.cmd`.
3. Your default browser opens `web/index.html`.

## Manual run (all platforms)
Open `web/index.html` directly in your browser.

## Optional Expo scripts (original prototype)
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- `npm run web`
